    "text": "I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Oslo, where I study the nature and consequences of partisanship in developing democracies, with a regional focus on India. My research explores how party-voter linkages take shape in volatile political landscapes, and what consequences they hold for broader political competition and political responsiveness.\nA second strand of my work also intersects with debates on gender and representation, corruption, and democratic accountability.\nIn my research, I employ a mixed-methods approach that draws on experiments, observational analyses and extensive field-work. In addition to my research, I teach courses on comparative political theory, survey methods, and political economy.\nI have previously held research positions at the Centre for Policy Research (New Delhi), NITI Aayog (Government of India), the Oxford Internet Institute, and the World Bank-Georgetown University collaboration. In 2024, I was a Visiting Doctoral Fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science."
